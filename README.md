# Welcome to my profile

## What I Do

I'm a solution architect and devops engineer, specializing in AWS and a variety of languages and technologies including Docker, Linux, PHP, Javascript, Java, Python, and SQL.  I love automation and DevOps as a culture, not a position.

I also dabble in iOS development with SwiftUI.

## When I'm Not Coding

I'm an avid amateur naturalist 🌱, mountain biker 🚵, backpacker ⛺️, and reader 📖, and in my spare time enjoy studying the natural world, computer science, artifical intelligence, formal systems, information theory, and physics.
