# Welcome to my profile

## What I Do

I'm a solution architect and cloud software engineer, specializing in AWS and a variety of languages and technologies including PHP, Javascript, Python, SQL, and Linux.

I currently work as the DevOps Lead for [PWCC Marketplace](https://www.pwccmarketplace.com), the world's largest trading card auction house.

I also maintain my own company, [The Walford Group](https://www.thewalfordgroup.com), where I provide independent services for software, infrastructure, and systems.

## When I'm Not Coding

I'm an avid mountain biker 🚵, backpacker ⛺️, and reader 📖, and in my spare time enjoy studying plants, mushrooms, computer science, information theory, and physics.
